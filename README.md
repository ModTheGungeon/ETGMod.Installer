FEZMod.Installer
===================
So... copying some files and running a .bat / .sh is not your thing?
It's dangerous out there - take this!

This is just an installing utility for [FEZMod](https://github.com/0x0ade/FEZMod), a mod for the game FEZ.

For issues with the installer, select the log box, CTRL+A, CTRL+C, create an issue here.

For issues with FEZMod, f.e. crashes, go the FEZ.exe folder, upload JAFM Log.txt, create an issue [in this repo](https://github.com/0x0ade/FEZMod).
